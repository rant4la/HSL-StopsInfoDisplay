# HSL-StopsInfoDisplay
This is a simple Node CLI app that displays any HSL station next departures in realtime. 

This app could be used to e.g. make an always on info display so that you can easily see the departures on your home station.

Usage:
1. Go to the folder where app.js is located.
2. Install NodeJS if not already installed
3. Execute: npm install
4. Execute the following command where "E0011" is your own station code: node app.js E0011
5. If you find to disable showing delays and show only scheduled departures use: node app.js E0011 delayoff
